## Simple stress test

This is a docker file for a simple HTTP stress test built in PHP, useful for autoscaling tests.

The image jleonardolemos/http-stress is built for this Dockerfile

**IMPORTANT: This image is not production ready**

### Building container

You can clone this repository and build your own container in order to stress your system:

1. clone this repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jleonardolemos/http-stress.git
```

2. build your own image:

```sh
docker build -t you/imagename .
```

### Running the container

Use this command to run the container:

```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 you/imagename
```

The service will be acessible in `localhost:8000`

### Get general information from server

Reaching the port 8000 you can see general information about the server, this is useful for print instance IPs behind a load balancer

### Stressing CPU

You can reach `/cpu.php?seconds=10`

This will stress a single core of the system, the param `seconds` is the amount of time in seconds that this CPU will be stressed, the default value is "1"

### Stressing Memory

You can reach `/memory.php?megas=2048&seconds=10`

This will get an ammount of memory for a few seconds, the param `megas` is the amount of memory(500MB by default), the param `seconds` is the time in seconds before the memory be released, 1 second by default.

**Important: if you are testing autoscaling by memory, the PHP builtin server handles 1 request per time and the request for memory endpoint only finishes when `time` is over, this will get your instance unhealth by the load balancer cheks**
